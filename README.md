# Simple-web-analysis
A simple python script to understand how web systems look from the outside 
It includes basic checks such as:
- HTTP requests and status codes
- Security headers
- HTTPS / SSL basics
- Open ports awareness
- Admin paths and robots.txt

The goal is not to build a professional penetration testing tool, but to gain basic web system and security awareness.
